/**
 * This class allows the creation of Handles, which are references to objects that can be tested
 * for validity and looked up. Here they are used to pass references to kernel objects to/from the
 * emulated process. it has been designed so that it follows the same handle format and has
 * approximately the same restrictions as the handle manager in the CTR-OS.
 *
 * Handles contain two sub-fields: a slot index (bits 31:15) and a generation value (bits 14:0).
 * The slot index is used to index into the arrays in this class to access the data corresponding
 * to the Handle.
 *
 * To prevent accidental use of a freed Handle whose slot has already been reused, a global counter
 * is kept and incremented every time a Handle is created. This is the Handle's "generation". The
 * value of the counter is stored into the Handle as well as in the handle table (in the
 * "generations" array). When looking up a handle, the Handle's generation must match with the
 * value stored on the class, otherwise the Handle is considered invalid.
 *
 * To find free slots when allocating a Handle without needing to scan the entire object array, the
 * generations field of unallocated slots is re-purposed as a linked list of indices to free slots.
 * When a Handle is created, an index is popped off the list and used for the new Handle. When it
 * is destroyed, it is again pushed onto the list to be re-used by the next allocation. It is
 * likely that this allocation strategy differs from the one used in CTR-OS, but this hasn't been
 * verified and isn't likely to cause any problems.
